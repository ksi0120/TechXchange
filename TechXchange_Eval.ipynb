It calculates the average of the reciprocals of these ranks across all queries. For instance, if the first relevant document is ranked highest, the reciprocal rank is 1; if it’s second, the reciprocal rank is 1/2, and so forth."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"28ada75e-2110-4fbb-a53a-516a7f518a2d"},"source":["# Preparation"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"420d046a-4b2d-465f-b31a-11d0539cf41e"},"source":["Run the cell below and restart the kernel.
